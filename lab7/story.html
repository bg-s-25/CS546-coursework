    <h1>The Story of Lab 2</h1>
    <main>
      <p>Adding the two new system calls to the kernel involved adding new entries to the list of system calls, 
        implementing the system calls in separate source files, and modifying the Linux Makefile to include the 
        new system calls during compilation.</p>
      <p>In working on the first syscall, I first added a new entry to the table file, which contains the unique 
        IDs and names of all system calls for the x86 architecture. Then, I appended the prototype of my system 
        call to the corresponding header file and implemented the syscall in a separate file. In that file, I 
        defined the syscall, which adds two input integers, prints the calling process pid, inputs, and output 
        to the kernel log, and lastly, returns the sum. After testing the first syscall, I started implementing 
        the second syscall by adding a new entry to the table file and the syscalls header file. The syscall 
        takes a pointer to a character array as input, replaces all occurrences of ‘o’ with ‘0’ and returns the 
        number of replacements that were done.</p>
      <p>Finally, I wrote a small program to test the two new system calls. The program prints the inputs to each 
        system call and the return values from the calls. The test calls I included were: adding 6 and 7 and 
        replacing the character ‘o’ in a small string. After running the program, the last 3 lines of the kernel 
        log show the results from the system calls.</p>
